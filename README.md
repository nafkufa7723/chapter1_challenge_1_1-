Chapter 1 Challenge 1 – Cryptic Message Decrypter
Project Description

This project is a Java program designed to decrypt a “cryptic message” given as a positive integer.
The program demonstrates basic programming concepts such as taking user input, performing arithmetic calculations, and working with digits of a number.

How It Works

The user enters a positive integer as the cryptic message.

The program identifies key digits:

First digit – the most significant digit of the number

Second digit – the second digit from the left

Second-to-last digit – the second digit from the right

Last digit – the least significant digit

It calculates:

Product of the first and last digits

Sum of the second and second-to-last digits

The final decrypted code is generated by combining the product and the sum.
